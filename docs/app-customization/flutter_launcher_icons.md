# Flutter launcher icons

This is an alternative to the icons generated by flavorizr. With this package you have the option
to generate Android adaptive icons, which with flavorizr you can't. Choose the best option that fits you.

The package will create several folders for each platform with each icon for
each flavor. For Android there is no problem but for iOS the case is different.
Because we are using _flutter flavorizr_ and the generated folder names for each
app icon set per flavor is different from the ones generated by this package we
have to merge the contents of the new icons to the old folders created by
_flutter flavorizr_ package.

We have to move the contents from:

`AppIcon-***.appiconset` -> `***AppIcon.appiconset`
